<p>Author: Brandon Minor (<a href="https://github.com/bminortx" class="user-mention">@bminortx</a>)</p>

<p>This program's goal is to allow for convenient use of the MATLAB libraries while also guaranteeing accurate simulation through Bullet Physics, a fully functional and reliable engine.</p>

<h3>
<a name="setup" class="anchor" href="#setup"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Setup</h3>

<p>SimLAB only requires a couple of things: </p>

<ul>
<li>MATLAB</li>
<li>Bullet Physics Library: <a href="http://bulletphysics.org/wordpress/">http://bulletphysics.org/wordpress/</a>
</li>
<li>Eigen Linear Algebra Library: <a href="http://bit.ly/LXBsEr">http://bit.ly/LXBsEr</a>
</li>
<li>Boost C++ Libraries: <a href="http://www.boost.org/">http://www.boost.org/</a>
</li>
</ul><p>Install all of these; order doesn't really matter here.</p>

<p>Once this is done, open SETUP.m in the top directory. After the comments, you should see these lines: </p>

<p><code>BULLET_DIR = '/Users/Trystan/Code/Builds/Bullet/src/';</code></p>

<p><code>BULLET_SRC = '/Users/Trystan/Code/Thirdparty/bullet-2.81-rev2613/src/';</code></p>

<p><code>BOOST_DIR = '/usr/local/include';</code></p>

<p><code>EIGEN_DIR = '/usr/local/include/eigen3';</code></p>

<p>Replace the strings after the variable names with your own paths, for each respective library. Add the SimLAB folder and all subdirectories to your path. After that, everything should work!</p>

<h3>
<a name="demos" class="anchor" href="#demos"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Demos</h3>

<p>Each demo has the same GUI (displayed at startup), but they showcase different things: </p>

<ul>
<li>BulletDemo: Shows off how easy it is to add shapes and constraints to the scene. </li>
<li>VehicleDemo: Demonstrates a Bullet RaycastVehicle.</li>
<li>OptimizerDemo: Seeks to perform Gauss-Newton optimization on a path. Still pretty buggy; I would stay away for now.</li>
</ul><p>Every function in every directory should have a bit of documentation involved, so just type 'help [name of function]' to look up usage and arguments for everything. Some of the constraints are a bit tricky, so this might help. </p>

<h3>
<a name="contribute" class="anchor" href="#contribute"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Contribute</h3>

<p>This documentation will continue to expand as things become available. I published this on GitHub in the hopes that it would become a robust library with the help of the community. With that in mind, if you have a feature that you would like to add to SimLAB, go to the issues page on the GitHub repo and file something in. If you want to be even more hands-on, fork this repo and run a pull request with your feature included. Odds are, it'll get added into the system. </p>

<h3>
<a name="other-things" class="anchor" href="#other-things"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Other Things</h3>

<p>Check out my other libraries at my github page: <a href="https://github.com/bminortx" class="user-mention">@bminortx</a>. I've been actively updating another physics library written in C++, <a href="https://github.com/arpg/simba">SimBA</a>. This project is much more advanced, but offers a more diverse skill set as well. Check it out if you're interested. </p>
