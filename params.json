","body":"[SimLAB](http://bminortx.github.io/SimLAB)\r\n============\r\nAuthor: Brandon Minor | gallimatrix ~at~ gmail.com | [bminortx.github.io](http://bminortx.github.io)\r\n\r\nAssociated Acts: ARPG @ CU Boulder, [Replica Labs](http://www.replicalabs.com)\r\n\r\nSimLAB is a MATLAB Physics Simulator that utilizes the Bullet Physics Engine.\r\nThis program's goal is to allow for convenient use of the MATLAB libraries\r\nwhile also guaranteeing accurate simulation through Bullet Physics, a\r\nfully functional and reliable engine.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to work on the project, or point out anything grossly wrong,\r\njust reach out! I would love to get feedback on this project. \r\n\r\n\r\nSETUP\r\n----------\r\nSimLAB only requires a couple of things:\r\n* CMake\r\n* MATLAB\r\n* [Bullet Physics Library](http://bulletphysics.org/wordpress/)\r\n* [Eigen Linear Algebra Library](http://bit.ly/LXBsEr)\r\n  \r\nInstall all of these; order doesn't really matter here. Make sure that you're pointing to the correct mex directory in the CMake script; it's a set variable at the very top of CMakeLists.txt.\r\n\r\nOnce this is done, open Matlab and run SETUP.m in the top directory. After that, everything should work!\r\n\r\n\r\nDEMOS\r\n---------\r\n\r\n[![The Bullet Demo in action](http://img.youtube.com/vi/IzXKR44iJ0o/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzXKR44iJ0o)\r\n\r\nEach demo has the same GUI (displayed at startup), but they\r\nshowcase different things: \r\n\r\n- BulletDemo: Shows off how easy it is to add shapes and constraints to the\r\n  scene. \r\n- VehicleDemo: Demonstrates a Bullet RaycastVehicle.\r\n- OptimizerDemo: Seeks to perform Gauss-Newton optimization on a path. Still\r\n  pretty buggy; I would stay away, haha. \r\n\r\nEvery function in every directory should have a bit of documentation\r\ninvolved, so just type ```help [name of function]``` to look up usage and arguments\r\nfor everything. Some of the constraints are a bit tricky, so this might help.\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n--------\r\n\r\nThe MIT License (MIT)\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2014, Brandon Minor\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\r\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\r\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\r\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\r\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\r\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\r\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\r\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
